Building ComfyUI Desktop
========================

This document describes how to build the ComfyUI Desktop executable (EXE) on Windows systems.

System Requirements
===================

Hardware and Operating System
------------------------------

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Administrative privileges (required for some package installations)
- Git (for cloning repositories)
- Stable internet connection (for downloading dependencies)

Node Version Manager (NVM)
---------------------------

NVM for Windows is **required** to manage Node.js versions. The build script expects NVM to be installed at ``%LocalAppData%\nvm``.

Installing NVM for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Option 1: Using winget (Recommended)**

.. code-block:: batch

   winget install -e --id CoreyButler.NVMforWindows --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements -h

**Option 2: Manual Installation**

Download and install from the `NVM for Windows releases page <https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases>`_.

.. note::
   After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or system for NVM to be available in your PATH.

Visual Studio C++ Development Environment
------------------------------------------

Visual Studio 2019 or later with the Desktop C++ workload is **required** for ``node-gyp`` compilation of native Node.js modules.

Required Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Visual Studio Community 2022** (17.12.1 or later)
2. **Desktop development with C++ workload**
3. **MSVC v143 x64 Spectre-mitigated libraries** (v14.42-17.12 or latest)

Installing Spectre-mitigated Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spectre-mitigated libraries are **critical dependencies** and must be installed separately:

1. Open the Visual Studio Installer
2. Click "Modify" on your Visual Studio 2022 Community installation
3. Go to the "Individual Components" tab
4. Search for "Spectre"
5. Check the boxes for: **"MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs"**
6. Install the selected components

.. warning::
   Without the Spectre-mitigated libraries, the build process will fail during native module compilation.

Build Script Overview
=====================

The ``scripts/build_comfyui_desktop.cmd`` script automates the entire build process:

1. Installing Python 3.12 via winget (if not already installed)
2. Installing the ``uv`` package manager
3. Setting up Node.js 20.18.0 via NVM (requires NVM to be pre-installed)
4. Cloning the ComfyUI Desktop repository
5. Installing Yarn 4.5.0 and configuring Corepack
6. Installing Node.js dependencies and rebuilding native modules
7. Configuring PyTorch with CUDA support and Nunchaku integration
8. Compiling Python requirements with CUDA support
9. Building the application for NVIDIA GPUs

Usage and Configuration
=======================

Script Configuration
--------------------

The script uses the following default versions (configurable at the top of the script):

.. code-block:: batch

   set PYTHON_VERSION=3.12
   set TORCH_VERSION=2.7
   set NODE_VERSION=20.18.0
   set YARN_VERSION=4.5.0
   set NUNCHAKU_VERSION=1.0.0
   set CUDA_PIP_INDEX=cu128

Path Configuration:

- **Python Path**: The script assumes Python installs to ``%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe``
- **NVM Path**: The script expects NVM to already be installed at ``%LocalAppData%\nvm`` (default NVM installation path)
- **CUDA Support**: Configured for CUDA 12.8 (cu128 index) by default

If your installation paths differ, modify the ``PYTHON_EXE`` and ``NVM_HOME`` variables in the script accordingly.

.. important::
   Make sure NVM is installed and available in your PATH before running the build script. See the System Requirements section above for installation instructions.

Running the Build
-----------------

1. Open Windows Command Prompt (CMD) as **Administrator**

   .. warning::
      Use CMD, not PowerShell.

2. Navigate to the project's ``scripts`` directory:

   .. code-block:: batch

      cd path\to\ComfyUI-nunchaku\scripts

3. Run the build script:

   .. code-block:: batch

      build_comfyui_desktop.cmd

4. Wait for the build to complete. The entire process may take 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on network speed and machine performance.

Build Output
------------

Upon successful completion, the script will:

- Create a fully configured ComfyUI Desktop environment
- Generate NVIDIA-optimized builds with CUDA support
- Include Nunchaku acceleration support
- Produce the ready-to-use application package at ``desktop\dist\Comfy-*-win.zip``

Troubleshooting
===============

Common Issues
-------------

1. **"Module was compiled against a different Node.js version" error**

   Run in the project directory:

   .. code-block:: batch

      npx electron-rebuild

2. **Missing Spectre-mitigated libraries error**

   Ensure you've installed the Spectre-mitigated libraries following the steps above.

3. **Permission denied errors**

   Run Windows CMD as Administrator. Do not use PowerShell.

4. **Python installation fails**

   Manually install Python 3.12 from `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`__ or Microsoft Store.
   You can also try using Anaconda or Miniconda.

5. **NVM not found error**

   Ensure NVM is installed as described in the System Requirements section. After installation, restart your terminal or system and verify NVM is available by running:

   .. code-block:: batch

      nvm version

6. **Network connection issues**

   If in mainland China, some dependency downloads may be slow or fail. Consider:

   - Configuring mirror sources (e.g., Tsinghua, Alibaba Cloud mirrors)
   - Using a VPN or proxy
